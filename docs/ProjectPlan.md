# Project Plan


## 1. Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Unity by creating a relatively simple organization game that should be able to be completed throughout the duration of the 2025 summer. The intended audience for this project is video game players who enjoy organization tasks; they'll be able to play the game to fulfill this desire. Another audience is other developers if they want to build upon this project so Iâ€™ll need good documentation and comments to assist in this.
