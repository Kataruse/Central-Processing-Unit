# Ideas
- Wilmonts Warehouse like gameplay, Organization Game
- A Set to collect Data for games people wanna play
- games are divided into blocks of data
- you can choose where is most efficient to store the data so that you can retrieve it later
- you make connections to storage devices similar to bioshock puzzles or maybe mini metro
- data storage is similar to organizing chests in Minecraft but data can be in all shapes and sizes so you have to make them fit like resident evil 4
